        <summary>MTPK I/O Goal: to build a true privacy centric website.</summary>
        <p>
            To build a privacy centric website, where data can be encrypted by the user and server.</p>
        <p>
            Users will have a choice of how they want their data to be stored on this site:
        <ul>
            <li>Level-0: Site Trust. You trust this site, Data is stored, and encrypted purely on this site. Data can be
                retrieved by admins. and Data will be
                unencrypted when the user logs in.</li>
            <li>Level-1: Zero Trust, Some data, such as the user's name, email, and phone number, for password recovery
                and duplication prevention purposes,
                will not be locally encrypted, but encrypted at the server level.
                Other data is encrypted locally, and further encrypted on this site. Data can not be retrieved by
                admins. Data
                will have to be decrypted
                after the user logs into the site. If the user loses their decryption key, they will be unable to access
                their data. Data loaded will retain its
                original encryption set by the user.
            </li>
            <li>
                Passwords will be further encrypted regardless of whether the user chooses to further encrypt their data
                locally. The user's password will be encrypted by the site's system.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Default data storage: All data will be encrypted at-rest, excluding the user's username, and user-id.
            Data encrypted at-rest and only decrypted once the user is logged in.
            Passwords will be further encrypted regardless of whether the user chooses to further encrypt their data
            locally.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the user so chooses, the data can be locally encrypted by the user, then additionally encrypted by the
            server.
            This gurantees that the data can not be accessed by any admins, including the site creator, myself.
            This can be proven, where if you login to your user account, and your data is locally encrypted, data
            retrieved
            from the server will retain your encryption, and will be unreadible unless you import your local decryption
            key.
        </p>
        <p>
            If there is a legal issue of the data stored, all site admins (including myself), will be unable to view
            locally
            encrypted data, however, we will be able to erase said data. If the user loses their local decryption key,
            they
            will be unable to retrieve their data, unless they store a master key on the server (however that may ruin
            the
            point of locally encrypting data.)
        </p>

        <summary>Project Development Plan</summary>
        <p>
            This is very early in development. As such, there are no specific time-schedule dates. This is a rough
            schetch of the sites development plan.
        </p>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Create user page's.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create user database.
            </li>
            <li>
                Implement basic storage with limits for testing purposes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Implement multiple-level encryption for user's data.
            </li>
            <li>
                Implement user localized encryption.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add various encryption algorithms for user preference.
            </li>
            <li>
                Open up for early beta testing.
            </li>
        </ul>
