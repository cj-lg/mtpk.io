        <summary>MTPK I/O: A true, Privacy Centric Project</summary>
        <p>
            To build a privacy centric website, we will focus around the Zero-Trust concept, and make it to where data
            can be encrypted by the user and server, but also unreadable by the server.</p>
        <p>
            Users will have a choice of how they want their data to be stored on this site:
        <ul>
            <li>Level-0: Site Trust. You trust this site, Data is stored, and encrypted purely on this site. Data will
                be
                unencrypted when the user logs in.</li>
            <li>Level-1: Zero Trust, Some data, such as the user's name, email, and phone number, for password recovery
                and duplication prevention purposes,
                will not be locally encrypted, but encrypted at the server level.
                Other data is encrypted locally, and further encrypted on this site. Data can not be retrieved by
                admins. Data
                will have to be decrypted
                after the user logs into the site. If the user loses their decryption key, the user will be unable to
                access
                their data. Data loaded will retain its
                original encryption set by the user.
            </li>
            <li>
                Passwords will be further encrypted regardless of whether the user chooses to further encrypt their data
                locally. The user's password will be encrypted by the site's system.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Default data storage: All data will be encrypted at-rest, excluding the user's username, and user-id.
            Data encrypted at-rest and only decrypted once the user is logged in.
            Passwords will be further encrypted regardless of whether the user chooses to further encrypt their data
            locally.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the user so chooses, the data can be locally encrypted by the user, then additionally encrypted by the
            server.
            This gurantees that the data can not be accessed by any admins, including the site creator, myself.
            This can be proven, where if you login to your user account, and your data is locally encrypted, data
            retrieved
            from the server will retain your encryption, and will be unreadable unless you import your local decryption
            key.
        </p>
        <p>
            If there is a legal issue of the data stored, all site admins (including myself), will be unable to view
            locally
            encrypted data, however, we will be able to erase said data. If the user loses their local decryption key,
            they
            will be unable to retrieve their data, unless they store a master key on the server (however that may ruin
            the
            point of locally encrypting data.)

        <summary>Flexibility in Encryption</summary>
        <p>
            We plan on allowing users to chose their local encryption algorithms, as it will be consuming their own
            processing power;
            user's will have the freedom to chose between speed, or encryption complexity. Of course, we will recommend
            a default
            algorithm based on current day security standards. If possible, we will include a salt on top of the
            encryption for
            additional security.

        <summary>Project Development Plan</summary>
        <p>
            This is very early in development. As such, there are no specific time-schedule dates. This is a rough
            schetch of the sites development plan.
        </p>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Create user page's.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create user database.
            </li>
            <li>
                Implement basic storage with limits for testing purposes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Implement multiple-level encryption for user's data.
            </li>
            <li>
                Implement user localized encryption.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add various encryption algorithms for user preference.
            </li>
            <li>
                Open up for early beta testing.
            </li>
